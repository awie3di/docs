## Before You Start

::: panel Complete the previous tutorials
Before you continue with this tutorial, make sure that you have completed the previous tutorials. This tutorial assumes that:
* You have completered the [Session Handling](/quickstart/native/android/03-session-handling tutorial and you know how to handle the `Credentials` object.
* You have set up a backend application as API. To learn how to do it, follow one of the [backend tutorials](https://auth0.com/docs/quickstart/backend). 
:::

After you set up an API, obtain the endpoint where your users authenticate. Declare the endpoint as constant in the current class:

```java
// app/src/main/java/com/auth0/samples/LoginActivity.java

private static final String API_URL = "localhost:8080/secure";
```

## Get the User's Access Token

Get the user's access token. For instructions, see the [Login](/quickstart/native/android/00-login) tutorial. 

## Attach the Token

Attach the user's access token to the request you send to the API. 

::: note
In this example, we use the [OkHttp](https://github.com/square/okhttp) library.
:::

Create an instance of the `OkHttpClient` client and a new `Request`. Use the provided builder to customize the Http method, the URL and the headers in the request. Set the **Authorization** header with the token type and the user's access token.

::: note
Depending on the standards in your API, you configure the authorization header differently. The code below is just an example. 
:::


```java
// app/src/main/java/com/auth0/samples/LoginActivity.java

OkHttpClient client = new OkHttpClient();
Request request = new Request.Builder()
    .get()
    .url(API_URL)
    .addHeader("Authorization", "Bearer " + accessToken);
    .build();
```

## Send the Request

Tell the client to create a new `Call` with the request you created.  Call the `enqueue` function to execute the request asynchronously.

```java
// app/src/main/java/com/auth0/samples/LoginActivity.java

client.newCall(request).enqueue(new Callback() {
    @Override
    public void onFailure(Request request, IOException e) {
        //show error
    }

    @Override
    public void onResponse(final Response response) throws IOException {
        if (response.isSuccessful()) {
            //API call success
        } else {
            //API call failed. Check http error code and message
        }
    }
});
```

Check if the request was made and if the response that came back was what you expected. 

You need to configure your server side to protect your API endpoints with the secret key for our Auth0 application. In this example, you can use the user's access token issued by Auth0 to call Auth0 APIs.
